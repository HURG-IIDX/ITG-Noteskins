---------- Installation ----------

The folder for each noteskin should be placed in your stepmania installation folder in the following directory: Your Stepmania Installation > Noteskins > Dance

These "should" work with versions of Stepmania 5, Outfox as well as ITGmania (I personally use ITGmania, so if there happens to be a version this doesn't work with my apologies)

---------- FA+ ----------

All of these noteskins have an FA+ version. For these to work, you must have the original (non FA+) version installed. Any changes to the non FA+ version will also affect the FA+ version, with the exception of note timing explosions (the only difference between regular and FA+).

---------- Bright and Night ----------

Bright is an ITG style bright and color saturated noteskin. It is structured like Cel, but the border is a solid color, and there is no gap between the border and the center gradient. The center gradient is a 2 colors that consists of the border color and a slightly brighter color.

Night is also similarly saturated, but kind of a "night mode" version of Bright. The only visual difference from bright is the center gradient, which is still 2 colors, but the gradient consists of the border color and black.

Both Bright and Night have color customizations for the following:

Active holds (default color: white)

Active rolls (default color: gold)

Hold/roll explosions (default color: white)

Mine center gradient (the pulsing color in the middle of the mine) (default color: red)

These are preview images for the color customizations:

COLOR CUSTOMIZATION:  There is a .zip in the Noteskin's folder titled "Color Changes". In that folder you will find the various color customizations for the above listed aspects of the noteskin. There is an "All" folder where you can simply change the color of all customizable aspects at once if you want them to be the same color (there is also a "default" optin in the All folder if you wish to change everything back to stock). To use any of the color customizations, just drag the.png files out of the .zip into the noteskin's folder

The following colors are available for all aspects: orange, blue, green, red, pink, purple, gold and white.

Mines have two additional colors for the center gradient: rainbow (bright looping full color spectrum) and vivid (looping colors based on the vivid/default DDR noteskin colors).

RECEPTOR CUSTOMIZATION: These noteskins have two types of receptors, Wave and Pulse. By Default, both skins come with "Wave". Both of these can be found in the .zip folder called "receptor change". Extract the .png file for either one from that .zip folder into the noteskin's folder to use it.

---------- DDR Bright and DDR Night ----------

These noteskins are based on DDR's default noteskin style, but with the colorings of bright and night. The holds/rolls are also greyscale with note matching caps to be more in line with ITG style noteskins. The holds/rolls for Night are darker to match the color scheme of the arrows. 

---------- DDR Cel and DDR Dev Cel ----------

These noteskins are based on DDR's default noteskin style, but with the colorings of the default ITG skin Cel and the Dev Cel color scheme used in some other noteskins (sold colors with no gradient animation, but the same overall note color scheme as Cel). The holds/rolls are also greyscale with note matching caps to be more in line with ITG style noteskins.

---------- Sigil Light and Sigil Night ----------

I wanted to make a noteskin based on sigil/magic circle tap/hold explosions. The arrows feature a portion of the sigil that pulses on the arrow , when you hit the arrow, the sigil "completes" and the tap/hold explion is the full sigil. Holds and rolls are light gray with sigil markings on them and turn purple when active, which also matches the hold explosion color. Mines are a white rotating sigil with alternating pulsing center circle and inner triangle

---------- Credits ----------

Bright and Night are graphical overhauls of Peter Lawrence A.K.A. Megasphere's "Ionic" Noteskin. You can find his noteskins here: https://github.com/Pete-Lawrence/Peters-Noteskins

The DDR variations (cel/dev cel/bright/night) are all edits of Schneider's Classic DDR Noteskins. You can find the originals here: https://github.com/SchneiderAFX/Schneiders-Classic-DDR-Noteskins

Sigil noteskins are using the default simply love noteskin "Enchantment" as a base just with all of the graphics files replaced. Slight changes were made to the code for mines (16 frame animation instead of 8) and hold explosions (uses "Decent" explsion for ending hold/roll explosions to keep purple color).
